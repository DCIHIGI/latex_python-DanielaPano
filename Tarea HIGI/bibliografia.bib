abstract = {In this review article, we discuss the current status of particle dark matter, including experimental evidence and theoretical motivations. We discuss a wide array of candidates for particle dark matter, but focus on neutralinos in models of supersymmetry and Kaluza–Klein dark matter in models of universal extra dimensions. We devote much of our attention to direct and indirect detection techniques, the constraints placed by these experiments and the reach of future experimental efforts.}

abstract = {We investigate the possibility that dark matter could be made of scalar candidates and focus, in particular, on the unusual mass range between a few MeVs and a few GeVs. After showing why the Lee–Weinberg limit (which usually forbids a dark matter mass below a few GeVs) does not necessarily apply in the case of scalar particles, we discuss how light candidates (mdm<O(GeV)) can satisfy both the gamma ray and relic density constraints. We find two possibilities. Either dark matter is coupled to heavy fermions (but if mdm≲100 MeV, an asymmetry between the dark matter particle and antiparticle number densities is likely to be required), or dark matter is coupled to a new light gauge boson U. The (collisional) damping of light candidates is, in some circumstances, large enough to be mentioned, but in most cases too small to generate a non-linear matter power spectrum at the present epoch that differs significantly from the cold dark matter spectrum. On the other hand, heavier scalar dark matter particles (i.e., with mdm≳O(GeV)) turn out to be much less constrained. We finally discuss a theoretical framework for scalar candidates, inspired from theories with N=2 extended supersymmetry and/or extra space dimensions, in which the dark matter stability results from a new discrete (or continuous) symmetry.}

	abstract = {We investigate the gravitational lensing properties of dark matter halos with Burkert profiles. We derive an analytic expression for the lens equation and use it to compute the magnification, impact parameter, and image separations for strong lensing. For the scaling relation that provides the best fits to spiral galaxy rotation curve data, Burkert halos will not produce strong lensing, even if this scaling relation extends up to masses of galaxy clusters. Tests of a simple model of an exponential stellar disk superposed on a Burkert profile halo demonstrate that strong lensing is unlikely without an additional concentration of mass in the galaxy center (e.g., a bulge). The fact that most strong lenses on galactic scales are elliptical galaxies suggests that a strong central concentration of baryons is required to produce image splitting. This solution is less attractive for clusters of galaxies, which are generally considered to be dark matter dominated even at small radii. There are three possible implications of these results: (1) dark halos may have a variety of inner profiles, (2) dark matter halos may not follow a single scaling relation from galaxy scale up to cluster scale, and/or (3) the splitting of images (even by clusters of galaxies) may in general be due to the central concentration of baryonic material in halos rather than dark matter.}

	abstract = {We present the current photometric data set for the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey, including Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry from Advanced Camera for Surveys, WFPC2, and NICMOS. These data have enabled the confirmation of an additional 15 grade “A” (certain) lens systems, bringing the number of SLACS grade “A” lenses to 85; including 13 grade “B” (likely) systems, SLACS has identified nearly 100 lenses and lens candidates. Approximately 80% of the grade “A” systems have elliptical morphologies while ∼10% show spiral structure; the remaining lenses have lenticular morphologies. Spectroscopic redshifts for the lens and source are available for every system, making SLACS the largest homogeneous data set of galaxy-scale lenses to date. We have created lens models using singular isothermal ellipsoid mass distributions for the 11 new systems that are dominated by a single mass component and where the multiple images are detected with sufficient signal to noise; these models give a high precision measurement of the mass within the Einstein radius of each lens. We have developed a novel Bayesian stellar population analysis code to determine robust stellar masses with accurate error estimates. We apply this code to deep, high-resolution HST imaging and determine stellar masses with typical statistical errors of 0.1 dex; we find that these stellar masses are unbiased compared to estimates obtained using SDSS photometry, provided that informative priors are used. The stellar masses range from 1010.5 to 1011.8 M☉ and the typical stellar mass fraction within the Einstein radius is 0.4, assuming a Chabrier initial mass function. The ensemble properties of the SLACS lens galaxies, e.g., stellar masses and projected ellipticities, appear to be indistinguishable from other SDSS galaxies with similar stellar velocity dispersions. This further supports that SLACS lenses are representative of the overall population of massive early-type galaxies with M* ≳ 1011 M☉, and are therefore an ideal data set to investigate the kpc-scale distribution of luminous and dark matter in galaxies out to z ∼ 0.5.}
